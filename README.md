# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

This project solves Sparkify's problem by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. The ETL pipeline in `Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb` transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
